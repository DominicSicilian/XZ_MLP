# Fitted Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for XZ

In this repository, you can find the trained deep neural network produced by [**Sicilian et al. (2022)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13825). Below are instructions for loading and using the model to classify XZ redshift values as either good (+) or bad (-) estimates of the true redshift.

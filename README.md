# Trained Deep Neural Network for evaluating XZ redshift estimates

In this repository, you can find the fitted Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model produced by [**Sicilian et al. (2022)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13825). Below are instructions for loading and using the model to classify XZ redshift values as either good (+) or bad (-) estimates of the true redshift.

## Dependencies

To load and apply the model, you will need [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Install with

 ```python
 $ pip install joblib scikit-learn pandas
 ```
